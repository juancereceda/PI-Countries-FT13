        Hello traveller! Welcome here, my name is Juan Mart√≠n and i'm studying
        Full Stack Development at Henry's Bootcamp. I've built this App so that
        you can find information about any country you want, add tourism
        activities to them, sort them by area, population and some other
        features. Feel free to come in!
